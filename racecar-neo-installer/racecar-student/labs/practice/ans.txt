             Connect directly to a local SFTP server program rather than a
             the client and server.
             necessary for servers that do not implement SFTP, for backwards-
             expanding paths with a ‘~’ prefix for older SFTP servers.
             at the expense of fully trusting that the server will not send
     sftp-server(8), sshd(8)
