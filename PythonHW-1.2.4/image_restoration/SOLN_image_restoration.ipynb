    "# Restoring a Noisy Image\n",
    "> Written by David Mascharka\n",

    "**This problem is *not* graded. The autograder will tell you if your solution is correct, but will not provide a hash. The solution notebook is available on EdX. **\n",

    "## Understanding image restoration\n",
    "In this problem, we will learn about a simple algorithm for removing noise from ('denoising') an image. We will want to use vectorization to write an efficient algorithm for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have an image that we want to transmit to a friend. During transmission, there is a 10% chance that any given pixel gets distorted. After transmission, about 10% of our pixels have changed colors due to this distortion. For example, we might start with the image on the left and our friend may receive the image on the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![noisy-example.png](attachment:noisy-example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to write an algorithm that will automatically remove as much noise from the received image as possible. The algorithm we'll use for this is called Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM). We'll only concern ourselves with grayscale images for this, but note that the same technique can be applied to color images as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterated Conditional Modes \n",
    "The idea behind ICM is pretty straightforward. It hinges on a very simple observation: in an image, color changes are very infrequent. Objects tend to have the same color throughout them, so the only color differences we run into are when we transition from one object to another. For example, in the image above we see a color transition when we look at the boundary of the circle and the triangle. However, within an object the color is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a look at the noisy image, we can see that there are a lot of color changes; far more than in the original image. Most of these are isolated to a single pixel. For example, see this blowup of the triangle:\n",
    "\n",
    "![blowup.png](attachment:blowup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the middle of the red rectangle we can see a dark gray pixel that's all by itself. We can be almost certain that this kind of discontinuity is caused by noise. The chances of a single pixel being a different color than all of its neighbors in a normal image is very low. If we change the color of that dark gray pixel to light gray, we'll probably improve the image quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what the Iterated Conditional Modes algorithm does. We define the *energy* of a pixel $p$ as the number of $p$'s neighbors that differ in color from $p$.  We will define $p$'s neighborhood as the four pixels immediately adjacent to $p$. If $p$ is at $(3, 5)$, then $p$'s neighborhood is $\\{(2, 5), (4, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6)\\}$.\n",
    " \n",
    "The energy of the whole image is the sum of each pixel's energy. The aim of the ICM algorithm is to minimize the energy of the noisy image by appropriately choosing color values for the most energetic pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can probably tell by the name, *Iterated* Conditional Modes is an iterative algorithm. At each iteration, we change the color value of the highest-energy pixel to match the most neighbors it can.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's fix a concrete example. Suppose we're transmitting a 5x8 image that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                                0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1\n",
